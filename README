Wolfen/WLonX is a Wayland compositor that simply wraps X11.

Interfaces that are implemented or being implemented:
-wl_compositor.
-wl_surface.
-wl_shell.
-wl_shm.

Hard dependencies: 
-Pixman, used for regions and buffer transforms (only if XRender is unavailable).
-Babl, used for pixel format conversion.
-Wayland-server, for obvious reasons.
-Xlib, for obvious reasons.

Soft dependencies (these can be disabled both at run time and build time): 
-Xext, used for shared memory and transparency if you have no compositor.
-Xrandr, used for getting screen information on most systems.
-XRender, used for hardware accelerated buffer transformations.
-Xinerama, used for getting screen information on legacy multi-monitor setups.
-XFree86-VidMode, used for getting screen information on zaphod and legacy setups.
